# Starting of github as a beginner

The start of how started with "HOW". Starting tutorial videos on how to use github on You Tube.  Ended up searching several videos and websites like How to create README.md file, finally found a website called readme.so where I am writing this text file.

Setting up git on local on Terminal is also starting step for me. After creating README.md file somehow, troubleshooting task on giving access to github. Failed to give authentication using GitHub username and password. Then, it suggested to use GitHub documentation on how to setup. Personal authentication warned me to use GitHub control Manager'. There I ran scores given,  and set up my Manager control set up. Finally, my local repository updated in my GitHub account.
